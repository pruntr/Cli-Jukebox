# Cli-Jukebox (for Windows)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/pruntr/Cli-Jukebox.git
   ```
2. Install required packages by running install.bat in the cloned directory as:
   ```sh
   .\install.bat
   ```

## Usage

1. Open a terminal anywhere and enter the following input
```play -s "song-name"```

## Note
   Currently the chrome instance for youtube runs in the foreground. <br>
   To change it to background, we'd have to remove adblocker as following: <br> 
1. You need to remove/comment ```line 22``` (the one with adblocker).<br>
2. Now Go to ChromeDriver.py and uncomment ```line 17```. <br>
